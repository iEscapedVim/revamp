Hey fellow keyboard warriors! 

Hopefully everyone is fine. Today I'll talk about something that's been bugging me for a while:
Why I left ubuntu and switched to Arch. It's bit like that first love that slowly curdles into something... opposite of romantic.
<div data-aos="fade" data-aos-duration="2000" class="flex flex-col justify-center items-center w-full text-sm">![Meme Saying We have all been there, right? .... Right?](./imgs/right.jpg)<span class="text-sm -mt-6 text-center text-gray-400">Hopefully not with our operating systems too often!</span></div>

I hopped on the Ubuntu train back in 2016, a simpler time when Unity was king or queen, depending on your preference. I was smitten!
It was fresh, exciting, and *it just worked* atleast for me. Everything felt intuitive, and I was productive right out of the gate. 
It was a real "Ubuntu-ty" call, if you catch my drift. 

Then things started to change. Ubuntu transitioned to Gnome and while I understand the reasons behind it, to me it felt like being forced to learn a new language.
My carefully crafted workflow? Gone!. My muscle memory? In shambles...  It was like they'd taken my comfortable armchair and replaced it with a gnome üëÄ <span class="text-gray-500">(come on.. It was good pun!)</span>

I went with it for a while atleast but the gnome switch wasn't the only thing that's been grating on my nerves, I mean I am toxic linux enthusiast but I am not that crazy, <span class="text-gray-200">Yet!</span>
Ubuntu started to get increasingly bloated. Like it's trying to be Windows, but without the you know, *Windows Part*. 

They're pushing their own ideas, like Snaps onto users, it feels less like a choice and more like a *snap* decision.... *but it's their distro ü§ì* <span class="text-gray-500">(Duh! It's their distro, You think I don't that?)</span>
The whole point of Linux in my two-brain-celled opinion, is freedom of choice. That's what drew me to it, in the first place!

And don't even get me started on the increasing number of issues that latest builds have Ubuntu's poping error left n right even on the installation screen. As a web developer, stability is paramount.
<span class="text-gray-500">(ü§ì‚òùÔ∏è but you are using Arch, Arch is not stable)</span>

Arch is very stable you just need to know what you are doing, we'll talking about that some other day, today I'm here to b*tch about Ubuntu.
I'm seeing more n more compatibility issues & general weirdness that makes Ubuntu feel less like a reliable workhorse and more like a horse that's tripping over its own feet.

It's becoming increasingly unfriendly which is ironic considering how beginner-friendly it used to be. I remember when Ubuntu was the go-to distro for newbie.
Now I'd hesitate to recommend it to my grandma, <span class="text-gray-500">(even though she's dead and didn't know how to read/write let alone know english but still...)</span>

It's a real shame, because I genuinely loved Ubuntu. Thinking past love I also loved nano over vim.. maybe I *was* stupid hmmmm ü§î ... anyway Ubuntu was my gateway to the world of Linux, and I have fond memories of those early days.
But we grew apart <span class="text-gray-500">(My friendship with ubuntu ended, Arch was my new best friend)</span> That was the last one no more puns

Anyone else feeling the same way? Let me know in the comments! After leaving Ubuntu I did use other distros but none felt the same way at the end I settled with Arch. I am using Arch Linux with Hyprland. Below is a screenshot of it as of writing this post *literally*.
